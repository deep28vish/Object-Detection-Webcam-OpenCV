Obejct detection via webcam - (OpenCV)
This notebook is 3rd of 3 notebooks. Here we will see how to use webcam of a system or any camera attached to a system for object detection the code is 99% same as we have seen in 2nd notebook - https://github.com/deep28vish/Object-detection-Videos-OpenCV

This small program gives you the ability to deploy the power of machine learning and Deep neural network to monitor a video stream. And because of the scalability there the only limit is your imagination. The code in this notebook is just a way to get started.

We will demonstrate Object detection Using OpenCV classifiers and this a method of detecting is relied upon CPU and covers the whole concept in just 40 lines of code.
